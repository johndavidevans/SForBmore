# SForBmore
The repository contains the code for a simple web mapping application showing the routes of historic Baltimore streetcars. This was app was deployed following the tutorial provided at https://github.com/maptimebmore/historical-street-car-mapping by MapTime Baltimore, a local open source GIS meetup. The app can be viewed at

The app is hosted on Heroku, and was developed using PostgreSQL + PostGIS for the backend database, Node.js + Express for the web framework, and the Leaflet + QGIS for GIS functionality and styling.
